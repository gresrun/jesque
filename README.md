# Jesque

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/gresrun/jesque.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gresrun/jesque) [![Coverage Status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gresrun/jesque.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/gresrun/jesque) [![License Apache 2.0](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque/blob/master/LICENSE) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/net.greghaines/jesque.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22net.greghaines%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jesque%22)

Jesque is an implementation of [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html). It is fully-interoperable with the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) ([Coffee-Resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque)) implementations.

Jesque is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project and depends on [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) to connect to [Redis](http://redis.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to map to/from [JSON](http://json.org/) and [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/) for logging.

The project contains a client implementation as well as a worker implementation that supports listeners.

*NOTE:* Jesque's delayed jobs implementation is not compatible with resque-scheduler

***

## How do I use it?

Jesque requires Java 7+. Download the latest source at:

  https://github.com/gresrun/jesque
Or, to use it in your Maven project, add it as a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.greghaines</groupId>
  <artifactId>jesque</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Quickstart:

```java
// Configuration
final Config config = new ConfigBuilder().build();

// Add a job to the queue
final Job job = new Job("TestAction",
  new Object[]{ 1, 2.3, true, "test", Arrays.asList("inner", 4.5)});
final Client client = new ClientImpl(config);
client.enqueue("foo", job);
client.end();

// Start a worker to run jobs from the queue
final Worker worker = new WorkerImpl(config,
  Arrays.asList("foo"), new MapBasedJobFactory(map(entry("TestAction", TestAction.class))));
  
final Thread workerThread = new Thread(worker);
workerThread.start();

Thread.sleep(100);
worker.end(true);
try { workerThread.join(); } catch (Exception e){ e.printStackTrace(); }
```

### Delayed jobs
Delayed jobs can be executed at sometime in the future.
```java
final long delay = 10; // in seconds
final long future = System.currentTimeMillis() + (delay * 1000); // timestamp

client.delayedEnqueue("fooDelay", job, future);
```

### Recurring Jobs
Recurring jobs can start at a specific time and execute at specified intervals. 
```java
final long delay = 10; // in seconds
final long future = System.currentTimeMillis() + (delay * 1000); // timestamp
final long frequency = 60; // in seconds

client.recurringEnqueue("fooRecur", job, future, (frequency * 1000));
```

### Cancelling jobs
Delayed and recurring jobs can be cancelled.
```java
client.removeDelayedEnqueue("fooDelay", job);
client.removeRecurringEnqueue("fooRecur", job);
```

### Using a ClientPool
`ClientPool` is useful in multi threaded apps, 
```java
final Client jesqueClientPool = new ClientPoolImpl(config, PoolUtils.createJedisPool(config));
jesqueClientPool.enqueue("foo", job);
```

### Listeners
You can execute custom callbacks during specific Worker events.
```java
int myVar = 0;
worker.getWorkerEventEmitter().addListener(new WorkerListener(){
   public void onEvent(WorkerEvent event, Worker worker, String queue, Job job, 
					   Object runner, Object result, Throwable t) {
    if (runner instanceof TestAction) {
        ((TestAction) runner).setSomeVariable(myVar);
    }
  }
}, WorkerEvent.JOB_EXECUTE);
```

#### Available Worker Events

* `WORKER_START` Finished starting up and is about to start running.
* `WORKER_POLL` Polling the queue.
* `JOB_PROCESS` Processing a Job.
* `JOB_EXECUTE` About to execute a materialized Job.
* `JOB_SUCCESS` Successfully executed a materialized Job.
* `JOB_FAILURE` Caught an Exception during the execution of a materialized Job.
* `WORKER_ERROR` Caught an Exception during normal operation.
* `WORKER_STOP` Finished running and is about to shutdown.

For more usage examples check the tests. The tests require that Redis is running on `localhost:6379`.

Use the resque-web application to see the status of your jobs and workers or, if you prefer Java, try [Jesque-Web](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque-web).

### Redis Configuration

As mentioned Jesque depends on [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) to connect to [Redis](http://redis.io/).

You can configure Jesque to connect to Redis given a URL in a system property (as used in Heroku + RedisToGo) with the following snippet:

```java
final ConfigBuilder configBuilder = new ConfigBuilder();
try {
  URI redisUrl = new URI(System.getProperty("REDIS_PROVIDER", "127.0.0.1"));
  String redisHost = redisUrl.getHost();
  int redisPort = redisUrl.getPort();
  String redisUserInfo = redisUrl.getUserInfo();
  if (redisHost != null) {
    configBuilder.withHost(redisHost);
  }
  if (redisPort > -1) {
    configBuilder.withPort(redisPort);
  }
  if (redisUserInfo != null) {
    configBuilder.withPassword(redisUserInfo.split(":",2)[1]);
  }
} catch (URISyntaxException use) {
  // Handle error
}
final Config config = configBuilder.build();
```

## Design Decisions

* I chose to implement the jobs as classes that implement `java.lang.Runnable` or `java.util.concurrent.Callable`. If the job requires arguments (most do), there must be a constructor that matches the supplied arguments. I felt this was the most flexible option and didn't require the jobs to inherit or implement a special Jesque class. Because of this, the jobs don't even need to know about Jesque at all. Furthermore, the client need not have the job's `Class` in its VM, it only needs to know the classname and all the parameters' `Class`es on its classpath. Only the workers realize the job and then run them.
* I chose to use Jedis because:
  1. It is simple to use
  2. Fully supports Redis 2.0 and uses the new unified protocol
  3. No dependencies
* I chose to use Jackson because:
  1. I was already familiar with it
  2. It performs great and does what it says on the tin
  3. No dependencies
* I chose to use SLF4J because:
  1. It lets the application choose how to log
  2. No dependencies

## Misc.

If you are on Mac OS X, I highly recommend using the fantasic [Homebrew package manager](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew). It makes installing and maintaining libraries, tools and applications a cinch. E.g.:

```bash
brew install redis
brew install git
brew install maven
```

Boom! Ready to go!
