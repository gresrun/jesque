# Jesque

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gresrun/jesque.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gresrun/jesque) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/gresrun/jesque/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/gresrun/jesque) [![License Apache 2.0](https://go-shields.herokuapp.com/license-Apache_2.0-blue.png)](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque/blob/master/LICENSE)

Jesque is an implementation of [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html). It is fully-interoperable with the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) ([Coffee-Resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque)) implementations.

Jesque is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project and depends on [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) to connect to [Redis](http://redis.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) to map to/from [JSON](http://json.org/) and [SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/) for logging.

The project contains a client implementation as well as a worker implementation that supports listeners.

***

## How do I use it?

Jesque requires Java 7+. Download the latest source at:

	https://github.com/gresrun/jesque
Or, to use it in your Maven project, add it as a dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>net.greghaines</groupId>
	<artifactId>jesque</artifactId>
	<version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Example usage (from IntegrationTest):

```java
// Configuration
final Config config = new ConfigBuilder().build();

// Add a job to the queue
final Job job = new Job("TestAction", 
	new Object[]{ 1, 2.3, true, "test", Arrays.asList("inner", 4.5)});
final Client client = new ClientImpl(config);
client.enqueue("foo", job);
client.end();

// Add a job to the delayed queue
final Job job = new Job("TestAction", 
	new Object[]{ 1, 2.3, true, "test", Arrays.asList("inner", 4.5)});

final long delay = 10; // in seconds
final long future = System.currentTimeMillis() + (delay * 1000); // timestamp

final Client client = new ClientImpl(config);
client.delayedEnqueue("fooDelay", job, future);
client.end();

// Start a worker to run jobs from the queue
final Worker worker = new WorkerImpl(config, 
	Arrays.asList("foo"), new MapBasedJobFactory(map(entry("TestAction", TestAction.class))));
final Thread workerThread = new Thread(worker);
workerThread.start();

// Wait a few secs then shutdown
try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch (Exception e){} // Give ourselves time to process
worker.end(true);
try { workerThread.join(); } catch (Exception e){ e.printStackTrace(); }

// Start a failoverWorker to failback from the failoverQueue
final Worker failoverWorker = new FailoverWorkerImpl(config);
final Thread failoverWorkerThread = new Thread(failoverWorker);
failoverWorkerThread.start();

```

For more usage examples check the tests. The tests require that Redis is running on localhost:6379.

Use the resque-web application to see the status of your jobs and workers or, if you prefer Java, try [Jesque-Web](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque-web).

## Design Decisions

* I chose to implement the jobs as classes that implement `java.lang.Runnable` or `java.util.concurrent.Callable`. If the job requires arguments (most do), there must be a constructor that matches the supplied arguments. I felt this was the most flexible option and didn't require the jobs to inherit or implement a special Jesque class. Because of this, the jobs don't even need to know about Jesque at all. Furthermore, the client need not have the job's `Class` in it's VM, it only needs to know the classname and all the parameters' `Class`es on it's classpath. Only the workers realize the job and then run them.
* I chose to use Jedis because:
	1. It is simple to use
	2. Fully supports Redis 2.0 and uses the new unified protocol
	3. No dependencies
* I chose to use Jackson because:
	1. I was already familiar with it
	2. It performs great and does what it says on the tin
	3. No dependencies
* I chose to use SLF4J because:
	1. It lets the application choose how to log
	2. No dependencies

## Misc.

If you are on Mac OS X, I highly recommend using the fantasic [Homebrew package manager](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew). It makes installing and maintaining libraries, tools and applications a cinch. E.g.:

```bash
brew install redis
brew install git
brew install maven
gem install resque
```

Boom! Ready to go!
